| %% Example MATLAB File for |enjaden|
| % 
| % This is an example of a MATLAB file which publishes nicely to Jade via
| % the |enjaden| tool. It shows what types of paragraph styles and inline
| % markup are possible, like *bold* and _italic_ markup.
| %
| % New paragraphs will each get their own &lt;p&gt; tag.
| %
| % It shows <https://github.com/tuckermcclure/m2jade links>. Links are only
| % captured when they look like the above. Note that < this > will note show
| % up as a link, and neither will <strong>this</strong>.
| %
| % There are numerous paragraph styles, such as code blocks:
| %
| %   code
| %   line 2: code
| %   line 3: code
| %
| % and preformatted text:
| %
| %  PRE
| %     TEXT
| %
| % There are also the expected ordered and unordered lists. Note that these
| % must be offset with a spacer line so that they can be differentiated from
| % *bold* inline text that happens to start a new line.
| %
| % * This is the first part of the list.
| % * This is the second part. It's longer than the first. In fact, it's so
| %   long that it extends to a new line, without breaking the list.
| % * This is the third and final thing.
| %
| % Numbered lists work the same way:
| %
| % # Thing 1
| % # Thing 2
| % # Thing 3
| 
| %% Some Actual Code
| % 
| % Here in this section (marked with %%), we'll include some actual code.
| % When |enjaden| comes across this, it will evaluate it and show the
| % resulting command window output and figures, just below the code.
| 
| % Make a series of random walks.
| t = 1:1000;
| y = cumsum(randn(5, length(t)), 2);
| y(:, end)
| 
| % Plot some things.
| figure(1);
| clf();
| plot(t, y);
| xlabel('Time');
| ylabel('Position');
| title('Random Walks');
| 
| %% Second Section
| % In this section, we'll highlight that you don't *always* have to skip a
| % line between the header and paragraph. But we might want to before
| % inserting an image so that it will get its own line and not be part of
| % the paragraph:
| % 
| % <<../ml2jade-logo.png>>
| 
| %%
| % Note that the location of the image can be absolute or relative to the 
| % file.
| 
| %% Section the Third
| %
| % Note that any time you change a figure, it gets included in the output.
| % Let's add some units to the x axis.
| 
| xlabel('Time (s)');
| 
| %%
| % By the way, we can keep adding paragraphs by making new %% sections and
| % just not giving them headers.
| 
| %% A Demonstration of Equations
| % 
| % This part is pretty fun. _We're going to show how to use MathJax for 
| % equations_! This looks way better than what |publish| does. (Also, note
| % that the inline markup in this paragraph spans multiple lines; it's still
| % detected correctly.)
| %
| % Inline equations use single dollar signs, like $x$. Let's discuss in more
| % detail in a _display equation_:
| %
| % $$x = f(x)$$
| %
| % Looks nice, right? The only downside to using MathJax is that one must be
| % connected to the internet. So if you're publishing a MATLAB file to Jade
| % from a desert island (or, more likely, on some ancient plane that doesn't
| % give you free wifi), you won't be able to see your equations.
| 
| %%
| % This concludes the example. See |ml2jade_example.jade| for an example of
| % a Jade file ready to have its MATLAB sections evaluated and inserted into
| % a new Jade file.
